Verso Inscription on an Image of the Pure Land of Great Bliss

by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje

Embodiment arising from the light rays of compassionOf the ocean of Victorious Ones throughout
the three times,Teacher and Victorious One, Amitābha,Together with emanated bodhisattvas,
male and female,And many billions of assembled śrāvakas,All of you who have true compassion,Please
look upon us with your great wisdom!In accordance with the pledge you made before,Protect
me and all infinite sentient beingsFrom the fears of the lower realms of saṃsāra,Liberate
our outer and inner sufferings into space,And having benefitted us and others
spontaneously,Please make us inseparable from youWithin the space of the great bliss of immortality.


Pal Karmapa wrote this at the request of Nyenpön Chimé.
